# The Spatial Bioeconomic Optimization Model for Agroecology (spBiMA)

### About
This tool uses code provided by CoMOLA (Constrained Multi-objective Optimisation of Land use Allocation) (Strauch et al 2018) and COMOLA-SWAT plus OPTAIN (Strauch and Shurz et al 2024). 

CoMOLA is a free Python tool for optimising land use allocation for multiple objectives. It is based on the open source Python library "inspyred" and includes functions for handling land use maps within genetic algorithms (GA, NSGA-II). In its basic form (https://github.com/michstrauch/CoMOLA), CoMOLA can be used immediately by inputting a raster map representing status quo land use, ready-to-run models written in R, including their input data, and (optional) information on constraints.

We do not claim any originality as much of the code was already developed in CoMOLA and CoMOLA-SWATplus
